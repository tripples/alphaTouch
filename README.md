## Introduction

Isn't it cool to open calculator by drawing '+' sign on the touch-pad? or Reboot your machine by drawing 'O' and Shutdown by drawing 'X' on touch-pad? `alphaTouch` is a smarter way to execute the applications or programs based on the patterns drawn on the touch-pad. Currently it identifies all alphabets. (You can see in the `applications` file for the patterns it identifies.)


It uses [synclient](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Touchpad_Synaptics#Synclient) utility to get the information from the touch-pad.

## Installation

Clone the repo:
    
    $ git clone https://github.com/sagarrakshe/alphaTouch.git

Run `install.sh`:
    
    $ ./install.sh

After successful installation of the package, inorder to use `synclient` you will need to Enable `SHMConfig` (Shared Memory) option. 

For `Ubuntu` users, open file:
   
    /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/50-synaptics.conf

For `Debian` users, open file:
   
    /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/50-synaptics.conf

Add the **SHMConfig** option into the document as shown below:


    Section "InputClass"
    Identifier "enable synaptics SHMConfig"
    MatchIsTouchpad "on"
    MatchDevicePath "/dev/input/event*"
    Option "SHMConfig" "on"
    EndSection

(Here's my  [file](http://paste.ubuntu.com/5747634/) for reference.)

You need to reboot your machine in order to take place the effect. 

## Configuration

To configure your touch-pad for this utility, run `config.py`

    $ python config.py

Follow the instructions and after succesful execution you will get a file - `CONFIGURATION`.
You can configure as many times you need it or you can manually edit the `CONFIGURATION` file provided it's protocol is followed.

##Usage

The program forms a grid on touch-pad as shown below. 
Each intersection is numbered from 1 to 25. A pattern is defined by the order of this numbers.

**Files**:

`CONFIGURATION` - 
    This file contains the co-ordinates of the **four corners** of your touch-pad and the **time-limit** to draw the pattern. 

`mapPattern` - 
    This file contain the records of pattern and the corresponding alphabet. For    example consider this record, `[[[3, 8, 13, 18, 23], [3, 4, 5], [13, 14]], 3, 'F']`.The first arguemnt(list) denotes the pattern, the second one denotes the no. of lines(3) in the pattern and the last one denotes the corresponding alphabet(F).

`applications` - 
    This file contains the list applications corresponding to the particular alphabet
    . For example, `'F':'firefox'` on identifying letter 'F', 'firefox' applications will be opened. Edit this file to your own fit. 

The `time-limit` to draw pattern is by default 8 seconds. You can set it in the `CONFIGURATION` file.

Lift your hand after a **straight** line and a **curve**. As shown below.

![curve line](https://raw.github.com/sagarrakshe/alphaTouch/master/_assets/C.png)

Let say you want to open **firefox**. 

Run `main.py`:

    `$ python main.py`

Imagine the 5X5 grid on your touch-pad and draw the pattern as follows. After drawing one line lift your hand and then draw the second line. If the total order of the numbers matches exactly with the one in the `mapPattern` file then **firefox** will open!
